Namaste | Hola | Hello 🙏,

<img align="right" height="400" width="400" alt="GIF" src="https://i.imgur.com/yHI0Wri.gif" />

To briefly introduce myself, I am a Computer Science Engineering graduate and unofficial Growth Hacker ⚡ with a motto of simplifying developer things by helping them with a perfect blend of code & content. 🚀

My aim is to connect the dots between developers and organizations by sharing technical aspects of the product. I love ❤ to scale things not only by writing pieces of code but also by adding some growth hacking flavors of marketing. 💰

I have been actively involved in developer relations roles for more than 3 years now and you can mainly found me hanging out with developers in Mobile, Web, and NoSQL (Redis) communities.

🚧 Some of my daily tasks at work are 🚧

✔ Building go-to-market strategies.<br>
✔ Interacting and planning developer interviews.<br>
✔ Engineering developer platforms for tutorials and blogging.<br>
✔ Designing Engineer's newsletter.<br>
✔ Speaking at Developer Conference.<br>
✔ Sometimes writing a blog.<br>

Additional to the above, I am a community volunteer for Redis and a content creator for the company. I love creating demos and tutorials to simplify developer issues and efforts.

Thank you 🎈<br>
Always happy to chat 🔰.<br>
